#Description of Idea<br>
==>
As we know, many people are following an unhealthy diet routine these days and newer diseases and infections are coming out. In the current time, people are becoming obese and diabetic and their health condition is deteriorating day by day.
Even in the covid time where people are working from home and they are becoming lethargic and unhealthier day by day. When working from home, their eating habits have been totally ruined. So how to give them the same taste but with more healthier substitutes from anywhere, anytime about which they are unaware till today?
Therefore, We are making a website where every person can get a chance to find out substitutes for their unhealthy food. Here, bad effects of every junk food are mentioned pretty nicely and we are providing substitutes for every unhealthy food. Our plan is to change the eating lifestyle of Indian people and by linking our site with platforms like Zomato and Swiggy, we are enabling every Indian to skip to healthy food at the best prices possible anytime and anywhere. Even enabling a poor person to adapt to healthy foods at affordable prices and making them aware is our goal
